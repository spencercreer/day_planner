Daily planner application

This is a simple daily planner application that allows a user to schedule events hourly. Using `Moment.js` the current date and time are displayed at the top of the planner. Using jQuery, the HTML and CSS are dynamically updated with time.

The user may enter an event within each text area and save by clicking the cooresponding save button. When the user clicks the save button, the contents of the text area are stored to local storage. The contents of local storage are recalled to each text area when the application is refreshed.
